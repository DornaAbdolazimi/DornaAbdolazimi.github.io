## About Me
I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student in the [Theory Group](https://theory.cs.washington.edu/) at the at the University of Washington, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Shayan Oveis Gharan](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/). I completed my undergraduate degrees in math and computer engineering in Sharif University of Technology. You can find my CV [here](https://dornaabdolazimi.github.io/files/CV_Dorna_Abdolazimi.pdf). I am interested in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms. My main focus has been studying Markov chains using algebraic techniques.
